# Machine-Learning-in-Matlab
Matlab code snippets for few common machine learning techniques

1. An implementation of ridge regression, a linear regression with regularization (L^2)
2. An implementation of a vanilla K-means clustering, K is configurable.
3. A logistic regression imlpementation, for 4 classes.
4. A chi-square kernel implementation to be used with libSVM (not added.)
5. Support vector machine imlementation with HArd mining training optimization. Works for linear kernel only. Stub for RBF and polynomial kernels.
